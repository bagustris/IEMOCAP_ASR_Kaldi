psn3F_hap_s06 look i've been ready for a long long time now
psn3F_hap_s07 look i almost got married two years ago
psn3F_hap_s08 you started to write me
psn3F_hap_s09 every day since
psn3F_hap_s10 i was waiting for you chris i mean till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say
psn3F_hap_s105 hey what time is it this pokes around midnight right god this is great isn't it
psn3F_hap_s106 look at the night we got i wouldn't trade this for anything
psn3F_hap_s107 you know actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but i was afraid you'd miss it how are you doing
psn3F_hap_s108 is that is that nah is that just paul i can't even tell
psn3F_hap_s109 but if i can't tell it probably isn't them isn't it probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think how are you doing
psn3F_hap_s11 you'd always be so ambiguous
psn3F_hap_s110 oh you know what i forgot i forgot my flashlight how could i be so stupid i should've brought my flashlight
psn3F_hap_s111 god oh you know what would be good right about now a six pack a six pack would be just the ticket
psn3F_hap_s112 i'm so stupid i should've brought a six pack god i'm like a little kid it's amazing i get out of the house with my fly zipped up oh ++laughter++
psn3F_hap_s113 i wonder if they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around
psn3F_hap_s115 honey this is a natural phenomenon it only happens once a year i mean think about the people in kansas they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this we're only forty minutes away this is too good to pass up
psn3F_hap_s116 well this is like the highlight the one night of their lives and that flopping around that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever( you call it
psn3F_hap_s117 but this is the big night for these guys their last life's last orgy
psn3F_hap_s118 yeah they do
psn3F_hap_s119 okay but it's fish that do something that no other fish do like the swallows in capistrano or the lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable
psn3F_hap_s12 i'll never forgive you for that
psn3F_hap_s120 look is that no is that just seaweed
psn3F_hap_s121 you know this is great isn't it you know i wouldn't trade this for anything
psn3F_hap_s122 i mean think about this i know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute
psn3F_hap_s123 somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way they don't why we don't know why they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies
psn3F_hap_s124 like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming this way they didn't you know they didn't make a decision they didn't you know have boats or anything no one sent them an invitation or a map they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters
psn3F_hap_s125 it's single mindedness with no mind it's urgency that's pure urge and they don't they don't ask it a question they don't give it a name they just swim
psn3F_hap_s126 they just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death
psn3F_hap_s127 oh i'm giving myself goose bumps look all my hairs are standing up
psn3F_hap_s128 ++breathing++ so what do you think
psn3F_hap_s129 about what i just said

psn3F_sad_s236 i know
psn3F_sad_s237 i didn't expect this to happen i never planned for this some things you just don't plan for you know
psn3F_sad_s238 i'm sorry babe
psn3F_sad_s239 i'm so sorry
psn3F_sad_s249 she's faithful as a rock don't you know in my worst moments i can think of her
psn3F_sad_s253 no you've got to believe
psn3F_sad_s254 you got to keep believing
psn3F_sad_s255 i can't help it
psn3F_sad_s28 nothing hey let's drive somewhere i want to be alone with you
psn3F_sad_s29 you remember overseas i was in command of a company
psn3F_sad_s30 well i lost them
psn3F_sad_s31 just about all
psn3F_sad_s32 takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men
psn3F_sad_s328 okay
psn3F_sad_s329 yeah wow
psn3F_sad_s33 for instance one time this it had been raining several days and this one kid he came up to me he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket
psn3F_sad_s330 mmm hmm i never knew it was going to be this hard you know
psn3F_sad_s331 it's weird'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually
psn3F_sad_s332 he had cancer you know
psn3F_sad_s333 they thought he got would get better and he did and then it just things turned bad
psn3F_sad_s334 turned around for the worst you know
psn3F_sad_s335 he was amazing
psn3F_sad_s336 i loved that boy
psn3F_sad_s337 we did everything together you know
psn3F_sad_s338 it's weird i think i feel so alone you know what am i going to do now now that he's gone
psn3F_sad_s339 he's so young it seems so
psn3F_sad_s34 that's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys i had they didn't just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly
psn3F_sad_s340 so wrong in so many ways
psn3F_sad_s341 his poor parents you know it's their only son
psn3F_sad_s342 kind of a whole year i mean he suffered with this this monster this thing this disease
psn3F_sad_s343 i know he was he had so much going for him
psn3F_sad_s344 so handsome so young so gifted
psn3F_sad_s345 so talented
psn3F_sad_s346 such a sweet person you know
psn3F_sad_s347 not very good
psn3F_sad_s348 can you imagine though you know as a parent just losing a kid twenty two years old
psn3F_sad_s349 it's weird i kind of feel like part of me is gone now you know
psn3F_sad_s35 a little more selfish and they'd still be here today and i got this idea watching them go down see everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created
psn3F_sad_s350 because this other half was just kind of like ripped away
psn3F_sad_s351 he was like he was like my brother you know
psn3F_sad_s352 he was my brother
psn3F_sad_s353 just seems so unfair is the way it is
psn3F_sad_s354 you know he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and
psn3F_sad_s355 kelly kelly uveny
psn3F_sad_s356 they talked about getting married and
psn3F_sad_s357 yeah but then when he got cancer and it got bad you know she just took off and
psn3F_sad_s358 so i was there for him
psn3F_sad_s359 yeah god i loved that kid
psn3F_sad_s36 it was a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me
psn3F_sad_s360 yeah
psn3F_sad_s361 joe do you think he knew i loved him
psn3F_sad_s362 i never told him i love you but
psn3F_sad_s363 i loved him so much
psn3F_sad_s37 and to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him
psn3F_sad_s38 and then i came here and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident
psn3F_sad_s384 fine
psn3F_sad_s386 not particularly
psn3F_sad_s387 i don't know i just don't
psn3F_sad_s39 and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all
psn3F_sad_s40 it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive i felt wrong to have that new checkbook
psn3F_sad_s41 open that new bank account drive the new car and see the new refrigerator
psn3F_sad_s42 cause you can take those things out of the war but you got to know when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that
psn3F_sad_s43 otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it
psn3F_sad_s44 and i didn't want to take any of it and i guess that included you
psn3F_sad_s464 did you talk to him
psn3F_sad_s465 he cried hard
psn3F_sad_s466 he's getting just like he did after he died you know what what what's the meaning of this
psn3F_sad_s47 how's it going how are you feeling
psn3F_sad_s474 tell me something you can leave this business
psn3F_sad_s476 i don't understand you do i
psn3F_sad_s477 yeah i can see that
psn3F_sad_s478 he saw it
psn3F_sad_s479 he was out there when it happened
psn3F_sad_s48 hanging in there
psn3F_sad_s480 about four in the morning i heard a crack and i looked out and he was standing right there when it happened
psn3F_sad_s481 i don't know but after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen
psn3F_sad_s482 no i figured the best thing to do was leave him alone
psn3F_sad_s483 i could hear it right through the floor
psn3F_sad_s484 i guess he is
psn3F_sad_s485 i don't know but i know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad
psn3F_sad_s49 so sad
psn3F_sad_s496 but from her letters i think she's forgotten him i'll find out
psn3F_sad_s498 i've given it three years of thought and i thought that if i waited then dad would forget about larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy
psn3F_sad_s50 yeah
psn3F_sad_s505 i know just you help me stay here
psn3F_sad_s506 i am thinking like that
psn3F_sad_s507 no you don't i'm a pretty tough guy
psn3F_sad_s51 you guys were real close huh
psn3F_sad_s52 i'm so sorry
psn3F_sad_s53 what happened what went wrong
psn3F_sad_s54 oh man
psn3F_sad_s55 how are they
psn3F_sad_s56 yeah like i mean if you need anyone to talk to or anything i'm here for you okay
psn3F_sad_s57 we're all here for you
psn3F_sad_s571 that's serious enough
psn3F_sad_s578 yeah
psn3F_sad_s579 yeah
psn3F_sad_s58 i know
psn3F_sad_s59 just things happen in life and you just there's just no explanation you know we just don't
psn3F_sad_s592 no i'm not sorry it's
psn3F_sad_s593 well you've been embarrassed ever since i came
psn3F_sad_s60 yeah
psn3F_sad_s601 no what is it is it your mother
psn3F_sad_s602 well then tell me what's wrong i mean even in your letters there's something ashamed
psn3F_sad_s603 you should tell me
psn3F_sad_s604 but chris it wouldn't work like this
psn3F_sad_s605 yeah sure
psn3F_sad_s606 how many
psn3F_sad_s607 geez
psn3F_sad_s608 and you still feel that way
psn3F_sad_s609 because you can't feel that way never again chris you hear me never i mean the money and me too
psn3F_sad_s61 i'm so sorry
psn3F_sad_s62 well now you can follow his footsteps you know carry out what he wanted to do
psn3F_sad_s629 let's drive somewhere i want to be alone with you
psn3F_sad_s63 well sure you could
psn3F_sad_s631 yeah i guess there is i guess i was but uh it's going from me now
psn3F_sad_s632 i don't know where to start
psn3F_sad_s633 you know when i went overseas i said i was in command of a company
psn3F_sad_s634 well i lost them
psn3F_sad_s635 just about all
psn3F_sad_s636 it takes a little while to toss that off because they weren't just men
psn3F_sad_s637 for instance one time it had to have been raining several days there was this one kid he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket
psn3F_sad_s638 i mean that's that's only a little thing but that's the kind of guys i had they didn't just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they'd still be here today
psn3F_sad_s639 and i and i thought something watching them go down
psn3F_sad_s64 yeah
psn3F_sad_s640 everything was being destroyed see but there was one new thing that was being created a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me
psn3F_sad_s641 and to show that to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him
psn3F_sad_s642 and i came back here and it was incredible there was no meaning in that here the whole thing to them was a bus accident
psn3F_sad_s643 and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys
psn3F_sad_s644 and i felt wrong to be alive to drive the car to see the new checkbook to see the new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man and you got to be a little bit better because of that
psn3F_sad_s645 otherwise what you have here is loot and there's blood on it
psn3F_sad_s646 and i didn't want to take any of it
psn3F_sad_s647 and i guess that included you
psn3F_sad_s65 i would've loved to
psn3F_sad_s66 now i can't
psn3F_sad_s681 every time i reach out for something i have to pull back because other people will suffer my whole entire life time and time after time
psn3F_sad_s746 do you remember the last time we came here
psn3F_sad_s747 we thought i was pregnant
psn3F_sad_s748 you brought a bottle of champagne
psn3F_sad_s752 i told myself finally this is how happy i'm supposed to be
psn3F_sad_s754 i don't want to remember something
psn3F_sad_s755 hope for some things
psn3F_sad_s756 no
psn3F_sad_s757 no
psn3F_sad_s758 no no
psn3F_sad_s761 things have never turned out anything the way that i thought they would be
psn3F_sad_s762 it's not something else do you know what i'm trying to say
psn3F_sad_s763 i know you are augie and i know you wanted this evening to be nice but i can't help thinking of being somewhere else
psn3F_sad_s764 i didn't say that
psn3F_sad_s770 i'm sorry augie
psn3F_sad_s787 oh dear well shall we want that
psn3F_sad_s788 well what if happens if one of us is to die does the one that's left still laugh
psn3F_sad_s811 we thought i was pregnant
psn3F_sad_s812 i'd rather not remember something
psn3F_sad_s813 rather not hope for something
psn3F_sad_s814 no
psn3F_sad_s817 this is just this you know i mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else do you know what i'm trying to say
psn3F_sad_s818 i know you are augie i know you wanted this evening to be nice
psn3F_sad_s819 i can't help thinking about being somewhere else
psn3F_sad_s820 i didn't say that
psn3F_sad_s821 augie whatever( i'm doing i'd rather be doing with you
psn3F_sad_s822 if anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard
psn3F_sad_s823 well i guess this is the wrong spot for the right people
psn3F_sad_s843 maybe if you were with someone else too
psn3F_sad_s844 i know but i know i don't make you happy
psn3F_sad_s85 do this whole thing by myself
psn3F_sad_s86 carry her for nine months and then yes
psn3F_sad_s87 it's not the same thing it's not like having you here
psn3F_sad_s88 i can't do this
psn3F_sad_s881 my worst times i think about her you know and i
psn3F_sad_s882 it's like i know as long as she's waiting i'm right again
psn3F_sad_s885 look it was just last week that detroit some boy came back he had been away longer than larry you can read it for yourself you above all people have got to believe
psn3F_sad_s886 i can't help it
psn3F_sad_s89 i'm sick of being strong for us
psn3F_sad_s90 and watch our child grow see her take her first steps her first words

psn3F_sad_s92 a whole year we're not talking about like a couple months here i mean this is a whole year
psn3F_sad_s93 what could happen in a year
psn3F_sad_s94 and this isn't the first time you know i mean you always sending you off to different places and
psn3F_sad_s95 i don't know if that's how i want to live my life
