what
no it isn't
i don't care i don't care do you understand i don't care if they bark if they roll over on the floor like hoops
you are quite insufferable i suppose it's because you're drunk
turn it on
i will not go away go away i hate you
listen indeed no no no no i am sick and tired of listening to you you sadistic bully
stop it stop it i hate you i loath you you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible
this is the end do you hear the end now and forever
oh yes i am
yes i am let go of me i hate you and i loath you god i can't believe i just finally realized how you are i am never marry you never never never never i would rather die in torment
beast or brute cad swine beast beast brute
as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden
i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him
i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste
you let him kiss you you said so
what about me
that's a nice point of view i must say
you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment
really amanda
nothing
going somewhere dear
yes it is
they snap
did you see much of peter burden after our divorce
i imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then didn't you
you had a riotous must have had a riotous time no restraint at all very enjoyable you never had much anyhow
i'm not in the least bit drunk
okay as i mentioned before i said i had three very minute liquor glasses that's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk
well i suppose the people downstairs then
turn it off
oh very amusing indeed amanda listen
very amusing indeed
you know you're a vile ill tempered wicked little beast and i hope that i never see you again as long as i live
no you're not going out like this no you're not
oh shut up shut up shut up
i wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile you're a mean evil minded little vampire and i hope to god i never set eyes on you again
okay i'm going to call security security
this entire time you're fighting with me sir you could've finished the form and already been half way no get out
why did you invite her here
she's been in new york for three and a half years she don't just suddenly come and
you don't travel seven hundred miles just to see
it's got that about it
she's not larry's girl she knows that
nobody in my house better ever dare dare to challenge her faith maybe strangers but not his father not his brother
don't don't laugh at me don't laugh at me
look at it because why when she came here and she slept in his room the memorial broke into pieces look at it look at it joe
all right all right calm yourself
why me above all
huh
why me above all
look at you you're shaking
what have i got to hide
huh what the hell's the matter with you kate
presents a trivial little broach
i don't know why you want it you've already had two glasses
i don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing
what
adders don't snap they sting
they sting
mind your business
you're quite insufferable i expect it's because you're drunk
you've always had a weak head
on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy
shut up
not very funny dear in fact maybe you better have some more brandy
very well if you insist on being a boorish and idiotic
you are far too temperamental try to control yourself
go away go away i hate you
i hate you listen i'm sick and tired of listening to you you sadistic bully
this is the end understand this is the end here and now forever and always
oh yes i am yes i am and you can't stop me
listen you're a cruel fiend and i hate loathe you thank god finally finally thank god i've realized just how horrible you are and marry you marry you never i will never marry you i will die die in torment
beast brute cad swine beast beast brute devil sorry
you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden
you must admit he was in love with you
you let him kiss you you said so what of it
and what about me
oh that's a nice point of view i must say
yeah so am i bored stiff
no particular reason anyhow they were very small ones
oh my just because i just okay
you needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment
i'm not in the least bit drunk
okay like i mentioned before i had three very small minute liquor glasses of brandy that's not even enough to get a child of two drunk
oh what an interesting( topic what about a child of four and a child of six a child of nine
we might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots
oh thanks i think i will
you better turn that off
no i'll do no such thing
come on turn it off it's driving me mad
turn it turn it off
very amusing indeed
you know what you're a vile little evil minded little wicked beast and i never want to see you again
you're not going nowhere no you're not
just shut up
shut up shut up i would i would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil minded little vampire and i hope to god i never see you again
oh
i don't understand why you're always saying oh it's mine it's mine it's not like it's just your flashlight i mean how do you think that makes me feel

welcome to the human race
do you think that this is what i had in mind that four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish no
i was just like you i thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids

no i did not drop my phone in water i'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere i see it okay this is my business
well
i guess that's why i came
look i've been ready for a long long time now
look i almost got married two years ago
you started to write me
every day since
i was waiting for you chris i mean till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say
hey what time is it this pokes around midnight right god this is great isn't it
look at the night we got i wouldn't trade this for anything
you know actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but i was afraid you'd miss it how are you doing
is that is that nah is that just paul i can't even tell
but if i can't tell it probably isn't them isn't it probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think how are you doing
you'd always be so ambiguous
oh you know what i forgot i forgot my flashlight how could i be so stupid i should've brought my flashlight
god oh you know what would be good right about now a six pack a six pack would be just the ticket
i'm so stupid i should've brought a six pack god i'm like a little kid it's amazing i get out of the house with my fly zipped up oh ++laughter++
i wonder if they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around
honey this is a natural phenomenon it only happens once a year i mean think about the people in kansas they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this we're only forty minutes away this is too good to pass up
well this is like the highlight the one night of their lives and that flopping around that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever( you call it
but this is the big night for these guys their last life's last orgy
yeah they do
okay but it's fish that do something that no other fish do like the swallows in capistrano or the lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable
i'll never forgive you for that
look is that no is that just seaweed
you know this is great isn't it you know i wouldn't trade this for anything
i mean think about this i know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute
somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way they don't why we don't know why they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies
like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming this way they didn't you know they didn't make a decision they didn't you know have boats or anything no one sent them an invitation or a map they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters
it's single mindedness with no mind it's urgency that's pure urge and they don't they don't ask it a question they don't give it a name they just swim
they just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death
oh i'm giving myself goose bumps look all my hairs are standing up
++breathing++ so what do you think
about what i just said
i mean why did you wait all these years there i was sitting around and wondering if i was crazy for thinking about you

hey what time is it they're supposed to run around midnight right god this is great isn't it
look at the night we got couldn't be better
you know actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the the people and the lights and uh but i thought we'd miss it hey how you doing
oh is that is that now is that just foam uhh i can't even tell
oh though if i can't tell it probably isn't them right it probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think hey how you doing
oh do you know what i forgot i forgot my flashlight how could i be so stupid oh i i should have brought my flashlight
uh you know the flashlight the silver one there's only one isn't there
we should have brought our flashlight i can't believe we forgot to bring it

we should have brought the blanket oh why didn't we bring the blanket our blanket
you know what would be good right now a six pack ah i can't believe i forgot a six pack a six pack would be just the ticket right about now
i'm so stupid i'm like a little kid i it's amazing i get out of the house with my fly zipped oh ++laughter++
i wonder if they can hear us talk or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move
no no no no that's not my point my point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave
i wouldn't miss this for anything i mean think about this okay i know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute
and they all all as one turned as one and formed this line as big as the california coast and started swimming this way swimming as if that's the only thing that matters
you know they didn't ask it a question they didn't they didn't take a vote they didn't have an invitation or a map they just started swimming as one
its single mindedness with one mind urgency that's pure urge you know they don't give it a name
they don't ask it a question they just they just they don't know what drives them they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here
where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death oh god i'm giving myself goosebumps look i'm all all my hairs on my arms is sticking up

oh man
did you say yes yet i mean have you sent in your answer
now what are you going to do about it
we took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand under the moon
all right
and you whispered so intimately in my ear so i could feel your words
oh that moment that was it
dancing barefoot in the sand drinking out of a bottle of champagne
this is so great you know because i gone fit on downtown so i'm going to be like right here i think i'm going to be living at city lights downtown
well i guess we're just in the wrong spart spot with the right person
i noticed that it's beautiful
you can see right over the water
at least we won't need glasses
maybe this is the right place after all
yeah it really is
actually now that you mention it no i don't
seemed like a pretty good spot to me i mean look at the view of the moon we've got from here
look what we got here
it's not champagne
man i'm just so happy for you i just
if we're very quiet the fish might come
or not
don't laugh at me i'm serious
thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i ever so much as catch you looking at another woman i'll kill you
well i'm happy for you but i'm happy for me cause that means you're going to stay
oh charles that was his name charles he did wiggle so beautifully
yeah and that was the first time you ever hit me
the manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers ++laughter++
i know oh man couldn't believe it
things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they
++laughter++ you mustn't be serious my dear one that's what they want
ooh certainly you must we're figures of fun all right
let's blow strumpets blow blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children let's savor the delight of the moment come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets
oh great i would love to go
remember that awful scene we had in venice
that was a rouser wasn't it
mmmm some miso soup
yeah i noticed that it's real pretty on the water
oh you brought refreshments
no i'm beginning to think you might be right
i think this may be the place for us after all
i am sorry augie
or not
um
so what do you think
why the sad face
i mean look at the view of the moon we got from here
hey look what we got here
shh if we're very quiet the fish might come
or not
at the end of the performance you know like we're all clapping and stuff and all of a sudden i look over and
joe's gone where did he go you know
and i'm like oh he went to the the bathroom but he didn't tell me i didn't even notice him leaving and all of a sudden i swear to god i'm sitting there and
he comes up onstage and the entire cast everyone just like
goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him
and i'm like freaking out i'm like what the hell's going on you know i don't know what's going on and so he's like standing there and then all of a sudden they give him a microphone
he asked me to marry him like onstage i was like i couldn't believe and i had to walk up there and i was like i think i tripped or something
yeah i said yes but i yeah i mean
i don't know it just like took me took me by surprise
he scored points
oh yeah everyone yeah and people friends of ours were in the audience i didn't know about like family members
yeah it was great
it was i cried
like a loser i cried
but i don't know i it's so weird to think i'm marrying somebody'cause i feel so young you know
no no plans or any and probably
like i think i want to get married i want to have two weddings one here then one in europe
yeah i'm so excited ++laughter++
yes
i'm just not
do you want my jacket
we're not twenty one yet but whatever(
that's going to that'll be reserved for somebody else

it's become a habit with you
it's a woman's job to allure the man watch me won't you a minute
are you bored with this conversation
so am i bored stiff want some brandy
i'll have a little i think
no particular reason anyhow they were very small ones
you're not sorry you came
this is no time of the year for tunis
how's it going babe
yeah
what
is that a demand sir

how do you know he's even thinking about it
well so what
you can't read her mind
how do you know why she's waited
look it's a nice day what are we arguing for
calm yourself
oh come on you knew there was nothing in that
no i didn't you made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination
just a little perhaps but nothing serious
well it didn't harm him in fact it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me
it's become a habit with you
no just making myself beautiful for you
that's the woman's job to lure the man watch me a moment won't you
they are away in tunis
yes the real cause of that rile was peter burden
you want some brandy

it's going to be okay
no i have to go

and if we survive if we survive that then babe you know you know we could survive any
i will come back
we'll have all the money that we ever needed
and and then i'll stop working and i'll stay home with the baby
it's all i ever knew how to do i can't quit now
well we we tell her mommy's going on va on a trip for for a while
don't do that to me
it's hard enough already brian i can't
i know
i didn't expect this to happen i never planned for this some things you just don't plan for you know
i'm sorry babe
i'm so sorry
she's faithful as a rock don't you know in my worst moments i can think of her
no you've got to believe
you got to keep believing
i can't help it
nothing hey let's drive somewhere i want to be alone with you
you remember overseas i was in command of a company
well i lost them
just about all
takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men
okay
yeah wow
for instance one time this it had been raining several days and this one kid he came up to me he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket
mmm hmm i never knew it was going to be this hard you know
it's weird'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually
he had cancer you know
they thought he got would get better and he did and then it just things turned bad
turned around for the worst you know
he was amazing
i loved that boy
we did everything together you know
it's weird i think i feel so alone you know what am i going to do now now that he's gone
he's so young it seems so
that's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys i had they didn't just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly
so wrong in so many ways
his poor parents you know it's their only son
kind of a whole year i mean he suffered with this this monster this thing this disease
i know he was he had so much going for him
so handsome so young so gifted
so talented
such a sweet person you know
not very good
can you imagine though you know as a parent just losing a kid twenty two years old
it's weird i kind of feel like part of me is gone now you know
a little more selfish and they'd still be here today and i got this idea watching them go down see everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created
because this other half was just kind of like ripped away
he was like he was like my brother you know
he was my brother
just seems so unfair is the way it is
you know he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and
kelly kelly uveny
they talked about getting married and
yeah but then when he got cancer and it got bad you know she just took off and
so i was there for him
yeah god i loved that kid
it was a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me
yeah
joe do you think he knew i loved him
i never told him i love you but
i loved him so much
and to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him
and then i came here and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident
fine
not particularly
i don't know i just don't
and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all
it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive i felt wrong to have that new checkbook
open that new bank account drive the new car and see the new refrigerator
cause you can take those things out of the war but you got to know when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that
otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it
and i didn't want to take any of it and i guess that included you
did you talk to him
he cried hard
he's getting just like he did after he died you know what what what's the meaning of this
how's it going how are you feeling
tell me something you can leave this business
i don't understand you do i
yeah i can see that
he saw it
he was out there when it happened
hanging in there
about four in the morning i heard a crack and i looked out and he was standing right there when it happened
i don't know but after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen
no i figured the best thing to do was leave him alone
i could hear it right through the floor
i guess he is
i don't know but i know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad
so sad
but from her letters i think she's forgotten him i'll find out
i've given it three years of thought and i thought that if i waited then dad would forget about larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy
yeah
i know just you help me stay here
i am thinking like that
no you don't i'm a pretty tough guy
you guys were real close huh
i'm so sorry
what happened what went wrong
oh man
how are they
yeah like i mean if you need anyone to talk to or anything i'm here for you okay
we're all here for you
that's serious enough
yeah
yeah
i know
just things happen in life and you just there's just no explanation you know we just don't
no i'm not sorry it's
well you've been embarrassed ever since i came
yeah
no what is it is it your mother
well then tell me what's wrong i mean even in your letters there's something ashamed
you should tell me
but chris it wouldn't work like this
yeah sure
how many
geez
and you still feel that way
because you can't feel that way never again chris you hear me never i mean the money and me too
i'm so sorry
well now you can follow his footsteps you know carry out what he wanted to do
let's drive somewhere i want to be alone with you
well sure you could
yeah i guess there is i guess i was but uh it's going from me now
i don't know where to start
you know when i went overseas i said i was in command of a company
well i lost them
just about all
it takes a little while to toss that off because they weren't just men
for instance one time it had to have been raining several days there was this one kid he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket
i mean that's that's only a little thing but that's the kind of guys i had they didn't just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they'd still be here today
and i and i thought something watching them go down
yeah
everything was being destroyed see but there was one new thing that was being created a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me
and to show that to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him
and i came back here and it was incredible there was no meaning in that here the whole thing to them was a bus accident
and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys

otherwise what you have here is loot and there's blood on it
and i didn't want to take any of it
and i guess that included you
i would've loved to
now i can't
every time i reach out for something i have to pull back because other people will suffer my whole entire life time and time after time
do you remember the last time we came here
we thought i was pregnant
you brought a bottle of champagne
i told myself finally this is how happy i'm supposed to be
i don't want to remember something
hope for some things
no
no
no no
things have never turned out anything the way that i thought they would be
it's not something else do you know what i'm trying to say
i know you are augie and i know you wanted this evening to be nice but i can't help thinking of being somewhere else
i didn't say that
i'm sorry augie
oh dear well shall we want that
well what if happens if one of us is to die does the one that's left still laugh
we thought i was pregnant
i'd rather not remember something
rather not hope for something
no
this is just this you know i mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else do you know what i'm trying to say
i know you are augie i know you wanted this evening to be nice
i can't help thinking about being somewhere else
i didn't say that
augie whatever( i'm doing i'd rather be doing with you
if anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard
well i guess this is the wrong spot for the right people
maybe if you were with someone else too
i know but i know i don't make you happy
do this whole thing by myself
carry her for nine months and then yes
it's not the same thing it's not like having you here
i can't do this
my worst times i think about her you know and i
it's like i know as long as she's waiting i'm right again
look it was just last week that detroit some boy came back he had been away longer than larry you can read it for yourself you above all people have got to believe
i can't help it
i'm sick of being strong for us
and watch our child grow see her take her first steps her first words
you said two years
a whole year we're not talking about like a couple months here i mean this is a whole year
what could happen in a year
and this isn't the first time you know i mean you always sending you off to different places and
i don't know if that's how i want to live my life
joe i'm serious i don't want to have to have a little girl to tell asking every day where's daddy where's daddy and have to tell her that he's away
far away and he won't be here
i'm done i can't honey

I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S ONLY A LITTLE THING BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF GUYS I HAD THEY DIDN'T JUST DIE THEY KILLED THEMSELVES FOR EACH OTHER AND I MEAN THAT EXACTLY A LITTLE MORE SELFISH AND THEY'D STILL BE HERE TODAY
AND I AND I THOUGHT SOMETHING WATCHING THEM GO DOWN
YEAH
EVERYTHING WAS BEING DESTROYED SEE BUT THERE WAS ONE NEW THING THAT WAS BEING CREATED A KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY MAN FOR MAN YOU UNDERSTAND ME
AND TO SHOW THAT TO BRING THAT ONTO THE EARTH LIKE SOME SORT OF MONUMENT STANDING RIGHT BEHIND US WHERE EVERYONE COULD FEEL IT AND IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO HIM
AND I CAME BACK HERE AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE THERE WAS NO MEANING IN THAT HERE THE WHOLE THING TO THEM WAS A BUS ACCIDENT
AND I WENT TO WORK WITH DAD AND THAT RAT RACE AGAIN AND I FELT WHAT YOU SAID ASHAMED SOMEHOW BECAUSE NOBODY WAS CHANGED AT ALL IT SEEMED TO MAKE A SUCKER OUT OF A LOT OF GUYS
AND I FELT WRONG TO BE ALIVE TO DRIVE THE CAR TO SEE THE NEW CHECKBOOK TO SEE THE NEW REFRIGERATOR I MEAN YOU CAN TAKE THOSE THINGS OUT OF THE WAR BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU DRIVE THAT CAR THAT THAT CAME OUT OF THE LOVE A MAN CAN HAVE FOR ANOTHER MAN AND YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER BECAUSE OF THAT
OTHERWISE WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS LOOT AND THERE'S BLOOD ON IT
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY OF IT
AND I GUESS THAT INCLUDED YOU
I WOULD'VE LOVED TO
NOW I CAN'T
EVERY TIME I REACH OUT FOR SOMETHING I HAVE TO PULL BACK BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WILL SUFFER MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE TIME AND TIME AFTER TIME
DO YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME WE CAME HERE
WE THOUGHT I WAS PREGNANT
YOU BROUGHT A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
I TOLD MYSELF FINALLY THIS IS HOW HAPPY I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER SOMETHING
HOPE FOR SOME THINGS
NO
NO
NO NO
THINGS HAVE NEVER TURNED OUT ANYTHING THE WAY THAT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE
IT'S NOT SOMETHING ELSE DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
I KNOW YOU ARE AUGIE AND I KNOW YOU WANTED THIS EVENING TO BE NICE BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING OF BEING SOMEWHERE ELSE
I DIDN'T SAY THAT
I'M SORRY AUGIE
OH DEAR WELL SHALL WE WANT THAT
WELL WHAT IF HAPPENS IF ONE OF US IS TO DIE DOES THE ONE THAT'S LEFT STILL LAUGH
WE THOUGHT I WAS PREGNANT
I'D RATHER NOT REMEMBER SOMETHING
RATHER NOT HOPE FOR SOMETHING
NO
THIS IS JUST THIS YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S A LOT AND EVERYTHING BUT IT ISN'T SOMEWHERE ELSE DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
I KNOW YOU ARE AUGIE I KNOW YOU WANTED THIS EVENING TO BE NICE
I CAN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT BEING SOMEWHERE ELSE
I DIDN'T SAY THAT
AUGIE WHATEVER( I'M DOING I'D RATHER BE DOING WITH YOU
IF ANYBODY WANTS TO BE WITH ANYBODY ELSE IT'S PROBABLY YOU PROBABLY SOMEBODY WHO ENJOYS HERSELF A LITTLE MORE AND IS NOT SO HARD
WELL I GUESS THIS IS THE WRONG SPOT FOR THE RIGHT PEOPLE
MAYBE IF YOU WERE WITH SOMEONE ELSE TOO
I KNOW BUT I KNOW I DON'T MAKE YOU HAPPY
DO THIS WHOLE THING BY MYSELF
CARRY HER FOR NINE MONTHS AND THEN YES
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING IT'S NOT LIKE HAVING YOU HERE
I CAN'T DO THIS
MY WORST TIMES I THINK ABOUT HER YOU KNOW AND I
IT'S LIKE I KNOW AS LONG AS SHE'S WAITING I'M RIGHT AGAIN
LOOK IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK THAT DETROIT SOME BOY CAME BACK HE HAD BEEN AWAY LONGER THAN LARRY YOU CAN READ IT FOR YOURSELF YOU ABOVE ALL PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO BELIEVE
I CAN'T HELP IT
I'M SICK OF BEING STRONG FOR US
AND WATCH OUR CHILD GROW SEE HER TAKE HER FIRST STEPS HER FIRST WORDS
YOU SAID TWO YEARS
A WHOLE YEAR WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LIKE A COUPLE MONTHS HERE I MEAN THIS IS A WHOLE YEAR
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN A YEAR
AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU ALWAYS SENDING YOU OFF TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S HOW I WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE
JOE I'M SERIOUS I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE GIRL TO TELL ASKING EVERY DAY WHERE'S DADDY WHERE'S DADDY AND HAVE TO TELL HER THAT HE'S AWAY
FAR AWAY AND HE WON'T BE HERE
I'M DONE I CAN'T HONEY
IT'S OVER
