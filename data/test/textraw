WHAT DO YOU MEAN A MISTAKE
WHAT CAN YOU PROVE IT WHAT PROOF DO YOU HAVE CAN YOU PROVE IT
to you it is to me it is but to your father you can talk yourself'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body so where are you

why
well what do you want me to do you're old enough known your own business
i'm sorry i ignore what i've got to ignore that girl is larry's girl
from father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl i'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but i'm saying i don't know where to go see i don't know
i don't see why it has to be annie
that's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's been five years
do you know what that'll do to you to your father do you know i don't
are you crazy
you have a business here i said what the hell is this
oh must you be inspired
well you don't want to think like that

i don't understand you do i
well i can see that

yes yes i like it for one hour a day i don't care if i have to grub for money all day long when i come home i want it nice i want a family i want to kids and annie is in the center of that
i am thinking like that

everyday since
because i was waiting for you chris till then you never wrote me and then when you did well you sure can be ambiguous you know
i'll never forgive you for waiting so long all i did was sit around and wonder if i was crazy for thinking about you

presents it was only a trivial little brooch
what would i do with a fortune
yeah that kind of went out of style didn't it
you're not sorry you came
ann i love you i love you
now and always sweet
it had to happen sooner or later
++breathing++

cannes mmhmm
the manager came in he found us rolling about the floor ++laughter++

i will never forget the look on his face
oh
we were very much younger then
i guess we don't need glasses
i'm beginning to think you might be right i think this might be the spot after all
to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death
look at this my hairs are standing up my arm i'm giving myself goose bumps
well so what do you think
look what we got here
shh
if we are really quiet the fish might come
why
is she on the run
oh she just needs to marry you

that's so cool uh huh
++laughter++ why did she pick you where were you
you were at a party and she's like hey you seem unattached she's like
that's unbelievable yeah
well i've known people who have done this before yeah you just it's really fun actually'cause you have like a fake engagement party and all your friends come over and like
yeah yeah and then yeah and then you know like you could like you could do like like sock her for a lot of money
like make her rent the apartment that you two have to live together in you know and you won't pay any rent or you pay like a hundred bucks a month or something
yeah

i can't believe i got out of the house without my fly zipped up even
well okay whatever okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do you know it's like those swallows that return to capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs you know
it's like a little bit of the unexplainable a little magic a little mystery i just don't see how you can not be interested in this
++laughter++
out there there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way
they don't know why we don't know why no one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction
they just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the california coast and they just started swimming
like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies and they all turned as one
and form the line and started swimming swimming that would bring them to this point here
it's like urgency that's pure urge you know it's single mindedness with no mind
it's crazy look at this i'm giving myself goose bumps the hairs are standing up on my arm
yes there's a big envelope it says you're in i know
++laughter++
i'm really excited yeah i don't know how i'm going to pay for anything but i also yeah loans too yeah i applied though for a bunch of grants and scholarships so i'm still waiting to hear on that
oh i know i know i know i know

every day since
beating around the bush
i will never forgive you all i'd done was sit around wondering if i was crazy waiting so long wondering if you were thinking about me

++laughter++
oh elliott worms don't pop
aw thank you darling the same applies to you too except that if you so much as look at another woman i'll kill you
oh charles that was his name he did wiggle so beautifully
the manager came in he found us rolling about the floor biting and scratching like panthers ++laughter++ how utterly utterly ridiculous
++laughter++ and very much sillier
i don't care then
no wrong number ++laughter++
what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us ++laughter++
with perfect poise
it's strange things that ought to matter dreadfully they just don't matter at all when one's happy do they
well what does it all mean that's what i ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth dear god what does it all mean
who knows
yes yes with all of his might
let's be superficial and just pity those poor philosophers huh let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can you know like small idiotic school children
oh come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets
oh see i don't care what you do see you can paint yourself green and run naked through the place vendome and run off with all of the men of the world i shan't say a word just as long as you love me best
that was a rouser wasn't it
++laughter++ i'll never forget his face ++laughter++
++laughter++ we were very much younger then
++laughter++
what would i do with a fortune
okay is that is that
god i'm so excited i'm like a kid i can't believe i got out of the house with my fly zipped up
look there see what's that no that's that's just seaweed
god this is great think about this i know you are not interested but just think about this
just all at once they turned and they formed this line as long as the california coast and some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming
it's single mindedness with no mind it is urgency that is just pure urge
so what do you think
about all of that about all i was talking about
i love you annie i love you

oh you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses
are you going out somewhere dear
for one thing your mother much as told me to go
and then you you've been kind of
he's dreaming of him again walking around
well i got an idea but what's your story
just give it some more thought
sort of embarrassed ever since i got here
he saw it
he was out here when it broke
four o clock this morning i heard a crack and i woke up and looked out he was standing right over there when it cracked
i don't know
i guess he is
you know larry is not coming back and i know it why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him
i knew they would
we've got to say it to him
sit down mom i want to talk to you
you know
i'm going to ask her to marry me
you know it's not just my business
so all right then i'll just go ahead with it
i wanted to get this settled first
well if she does then that's it that's the end of it from her letters though i think she's pretty much forgotten him
and then we'll thrash it out with father okay mom don't avoid me
well sure from your mother's point of view why else would i come
i'll get out i'll get married and i'll move somewhere else maybe new york
on this i would
then help me stay here
no
i'm fine
i umm i guess i guess that's kind of why i came
flashlight the silver one there's only one isn't there
oh well yeah of course
of course our flashlight what's your is mine mi flashlight es su flashlight
gosh i should have brought it i can't believe i forgot that
right
that's my point too
yeah they do
we just weren't in a good spot though
come on trust me i got instincts for these things okay so just just think about it all right okay i know you're not interested think about it
i guess you know everybody has to make sacrifices
there's babies over there though that need mothers
chris i've been ready a long long time
i have to find sitters
and your mother is close by
uh what craig's list oh the internet thing
i don't know isn't that that's all like escort services and things like that
he just
i almost got married two years ago
you know what i heard about that job i applied for that
yeah
i just i mean i call people up and i tell them what i'm good at
yeah
you started to write me
well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her
how do you know he's even thinking about it
how do you know why she waited
you seem kind of down
what do you mean
there's a lot of people looking for jobs
i don't know i mean i just don't think
did you ever think it might be your attitude that's
i don't know just sometimes you get kind of no i'm not saying that i just
has anyone ever just said anything like that to you before
right sure
but i mean you kind of got to you got to fake it'til you feel it right
i'm just saying that if i was looking to hire somebody in the or kind of no no no
no i'm just saying though that if i was a person who was hiring somebody i would not hire someone who was angry or upset
no
well you know a little if you were to listen to
i just don't want you to fly off the handle
you kind of have a short fuse
yeah
like this right now we're trying have a conversation
we're trying to have a conversation and you seem extremely hostile you keep cutting me off
i can't finish the sentence with you without you jumping in
and you're always right
you have an excuse for everything
i'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own
++breathing++
well what kind of field are you looking to go into
uh huh i didn't come here get in yelling match either
like larry's brother do it like you chris
they don't pay me enough to deal people like you
yeah sure
how many
well maybe he wanted see her
well uh he grew up next door to the girl why wouldn't he want to see her
and how do you know why she's waited
mmhmm
fine
that's not your flashlight
yeah
not particularly
that's the wind
about what
the flashlight the silver one there's only one isn't there
whose is it
oh well yeah of course
no
of course our flashlight what's yours is mine me flashlight es su flashlight
do they always run during a full moon i don't remember was it full last year
huh are you cold do you want my jacket no you know we should have brought the blanket our blanket
aw do you know i should have brought a six pack too a six pack that would be just the ticket right about now huh
i know it kind of went out of style didn't it
right
wait that's my point too
why not
honey this is like a natural phenomenon i mean people in kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this it's just forty minutes away for us it's too good to pass up
yeah but this this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do spawning or mating or whatever
this is a big night for these little guys it's like life's last orgy
there's like mystery here there's magic it's like a little bit of the unexplainable i just can't see how you're not interested
god i don't get it you know the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life
and last year i remember distinctly you said you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car
you're not sorry you came
ahh we weren't in a good spot
we just weren't in a good spot i'm telling you this is a much better spot i have instincts for these things
what's happening
well
what
well i was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so they just take it for granted that we're all set
not sorry no i can't stay here
++breathing++ and then you've been kind of
you've been kind of embarrassed ever since i got here
pretty much all
you can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men you know
like for instance there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks he just put them in my pocket that's a little thing you know but that's what kind of guys i had
they didn't die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly just a little more selfish and they would all be here today
to bring that on to the earth again you know is like some kind of monument and i thought i would just make a difference to them
but then i came home and it was incredible you know the whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident you know i went back to the rat race again i went to work
and i didn't want any of it i guess that included you
did you talk to him
cried hard
chris what's the matter
++breathing++
no what is it is your mother
he thinks he's coming back chris you marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead
you got to tell me
i don't know but he went back in the kitchen and he cried
no i figured i'd just let it wait
yeah i could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room
i don't know
wouldn't work like this
i guess he is
no i wanted to get this all sorted out first
then help me stay here mom
yeah sure
then help me stay
no you don't i'm a pretty tough guy
how many
++breathing++ geez
do you still feel that way
why not
no
i went to see her headstone a week or two ago
i used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died i just you know i felt like they were urban oasis you know there is always this green in the city
so i was like wandering around before it takes forever to find her headstone i always lose it you know
so i was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and i thought that i would take the candy and put it on her headstone and
yeah and she was like that's pathetic i hope you enjoy it
and i you know i mean i said i was sorry and i brought it back to her kind of and i like put it on the ground and she was like no it's fine she was like i would rather have her back honestly
i don't know it just like i felt so bad because i shouldn't have done it i don't know whatever
i don't know
at the cemetery
couple hours
it's weird whenever i go back to town i think of her i mean it's like i mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one and yeah she had cancer she had two brain tumors
my best friend heather she's got a we have a we built this like little there's a park prospect park and there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her
she used to have these poetry parties on memorial day
umm yeah
and the last time before she died i remember she couldn't really stand umm
but i mean she could but it was so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized and i remember looking up she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head it was cool
some i guess she memorized this one john dunn it's called death be not proud and
i remember too when we were she died at u c l a she had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with but i gave blood for her surgery her mom and i before so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back and she in her wheelchair like can hardly do anything reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room all she needs is a god damn audience you know
darling don't say that
do you want to go somewhere let's go
no no it's nothing like that
and i remember thinking this is it finally finally i'm as happy as i'm supposed to be
i'd rather not remember some things i'd rather not hope for some things
no
no
this isn't anything like i thought anything would be
i don't know it's it's complicated but it's going from me now
this is just this i mean it includes a lot and everything but it's do you understand what i'm saying
i know that augie i really do
i just can't help wishing that i was somebody somewhere else
i didn't say that
you are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else someone who didn't take everything so seriously someone who would enjoy yourself
augie i'm sorry
i don't know
it's kind of all mixed up with all these other things
no no i'm just like you i thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and
no you know what you get you know what you get you get this
you know over seas i was in command of the company
i know me neither
i'm doing the best i can
maybe if you were with somebody else too
no i know but i know i don't make you happy
yeah
well i lost them
pretty much all
takes awhile to toss something like that off i mean they weren't just men you know
for instance there was this one time when this kid it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks
he just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys i had
they didn't die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today
and i had this idea as i was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed you know but i felt like this one new thing was being made you know it's kind of like this this monument
you know that they were bringing something on to this earth a kind of sacrifice you know
i thought i would change everything you know and i got back here and it was it was like nothing had changed at all
i feel like i'm always just standing here waiting i feel like this night is going to be the night but it never is
i'd rather not remember some things i'd rather not hope for some things
you know i went to work with dad and i started that whole rat race again
i know you are augie i know
i know you meant this to be special i know that you wanted it to be right but i just can't help thinking that i can't help wishing that i was somewhere else
i didn't say that
you're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else somebody who doesn't take things so seriously who could enjoy herself
and no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them
augie i'm sorry
driving my new car and i felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator
maybe if you were with someone else too
i just i know i don't make you happy
'cause you can take those things out of a war but you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man
i'm sorry to hear that
and if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it
you've been taking care of it all
oh jesus
he sick for awhile
i felt ashamed and i didn't want any part of it i guess i included you too
i want you to know annie
did you get the mail so you saw my letter

THAT'S JUST A LITTLE THING BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF GUYS I HAD THEY DIDN'T JUST DIE THEY KILLED THEMSELVES FOR EACH OTHER AND I MEAN THAT EXACTLY
SO WRONG IN SO MANY WAYS
HIS POOR PARENTS YOU KNOW IT'S THEIR ONLY SON
KIND OF A WHOLE YEAR I MEAN HE SUFFERED WITH THIS THIS MONSTER THIS THING THIS DISEASE
I KNOW HE WAS HE HAD SO MUCH GOING FOR HIM
SO HANDSOME SO YOUNG SO GIFTED
SO TALENTED
SUCH A SWEET PERSON YOU KNOW
NOT VERY GOOD
CAN YOU IMAGINE THOUGH YOU KNOW AS A PARENT JUST LOSING A KID TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD
IT'S WEIRD I KIND OF FEEL LIKE PART OF ME IS GONE NOW YOU KNOW
A LITTLE MORE SELFISH AND THEY'D STILL BE HERE TODAY AND I GOT THIS IDEA WATCHING THEM GO DOWN SEE EVERYTHING WAS BEING DESTROYED BUT THERE WAS ONE NEW THING THAT WAS BEING CREATED
BECAUSE THIS OTHER HALF WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE RIPPED AWAY
HE WAS LIKE HE WAS LIKE MY BROTHER YOU KNOW

JUST SEEMS SO UNFAIR IS THE WAY IT IS
YOU KNOW HE HAD THAT REALLY PRETTY GIRLFRIEND FOR LIKE ABOUT A YEAR AND
KELLY KELLY UVENY

JOE DO YOU THINK HE KNEW I LOVED HIM
I NEVER TOLD HIM I LOVE YOU BUT
I LOVED HIM SO MUCH
AND TO SHOW THAT AND TO BRING THAT ONTO THE EARTH AGAIN LIKE SOME SORT OF MONUMENT STANDING RIGHT BEHIND ALL OF US AND WE COULD FEEL IT AND IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO HIM
AND THEN I CAME HERE AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE THERE WAS NO MEANING IN IT HERE THE WHOLE THING TO THEM WAS A KIND OF BUS ACCIDENT
FINE
NOT PARTICULARLY
I DON'T KNOW I JUST DON'T
AND I WENT TO WORK WITH DAD AND THAT RAT RACE AGAIN AND I FELT WHAT YOU SAID ASHAMED SOMEHOW BECAUSE NOBODY WAS CHANGED AT ALL
IT SEEMED TO MAKE A SUCKER OUT OF A LOT OF GUYS I FELT WRONG TO BE ALIVE I FELT WRONG TO HAVE THAT NEW CHECKBOOK
OPEN THAT NEW BANK ACCOUNT DRIVE THE NEW CAR AND SEE THE NEW REFRIGERATOR
CAUSE YOU CAN TAKE THOSE THINGS OUT OF THE WAR BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU DRIVE THAT CAR THAT IT CAME OUT OF THE LOVE THAT A MAN CAN HAVE FOR A MAN AND YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER BECAUSE OF THAT
OTHERWISE WHAT YOU HAVE IS LOOT AND THERE'S BLOOD ON IT
