psn1F_neu_s809 aw do you know i should have brought a six pack too a six pack that would be just the ticket right about now huh
psn1F_neu_s81 i know it kind of went out of style didn't it
psn1F_neu_s811 right
psn1F_neu_s812 wait that's my point too
psn1F_neu_s813 why not
psn1F_neu_s814 honey this is like a natural phenomenon i mean people in kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this it's just forty minutes away for us it's too good to pass up
psn1F_neu_s815 yeah but this this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do spawning or mating or whatever
psn1F_neu_s816 this is a big night for these little guys it's like life's last orgy
psn1F_neu_s817 there's like mystery here there's magic it's like a little bit of the unexplainable i just can't see how you're not interested
psn1F_neu_s818 god i don't get it you know the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life
psn1F_neu_s819 and last year i remember distinctly you said you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car
psn1F_neu_s82 you're not sorry you came
psn1F_neu_s820 ahh we weren't in a good spot
psn1F_neu_s821 we just weren't in a good spot i'm telling you this is a much better spot i have instincts for these things
psn1F_neu_s828 what's happening
psn1F_neu_s83 well
psn1F_neu_s84 what
psn1F_neu_s85 well i was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so they just take it for granted that we're all set
psn1F_sad_s02 not sorry no i can't stay here
psn1F_sad_s04 ++breathing++ and then you've been kind of
psn1F_sad_s05 you've been kind of embarrassed ever since i got here
psn1F_sad_s100 pretty much all
psn1F_sad_s101 you can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men you know
psn1F_sad_s102 like for instance there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks he just put them in my pocket that's a little thing you know but that's what kind of guys i had
psn1F_sad_s103 they didn't die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly just a little more selfish and they would all be here today
psn1F_sad_s104 to bring that on to the earth again you know is like some kind of monument and i thought i would just make a difference to them
psn1F_sad_s105 but then i came home and it was incredible you know the whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident you know i went back to the rat race again i went to work
psn1F_sad_s106 and i didn't want any of it i guess that included you
psn1F_sad_s108 did you talk to him
psn1F_sad_s109 cried hard
psn1F_sad_s11 chris what's the matter
psn1F_sad_s110 ++breathing++
psn1F_sad_s12 no what is it is your mother
psn1F_sad_s124 he thinks he's coming back chris you marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead
psn1F_sad_s13 you got to tell me
psn1F_sad_s136 i don't know but he went back in the kitchen and he cried
psn1F_sad_s137 no i figured i'd just let it wait
psn1F_sad_s138 yeah i could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room
psn1F_sad_s139 i don't know
psn1F_sad_s14 wouldn't work like this
psn1F_sad_s140 i guess he is
psn1F_sad_s145 no i wanted to get this all sorted out first
psn1F_sad_s149 then help me stay here mom
psn1F_sad_s15 yeah sure
psn1F_sad_s150 then help me stay
psn1F_sad_s152 no you don't i'm a pretty tough guy
psn1F_sad_s16 how many
psn1F_sad_s17 ++breathing++ geez
psn1F_sad_s18 do you still feel that way
psn1F_sad_s22 why not
psn1F_sad_s245 no
psn1F_sad_s248 i went to see her headstone a week or two ago
psn1F_sad_s249 i used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died i just you know i felt like they were urban oasis you know there is always this green in the city
psn1F_sad_s250 so i was like wandering around before it takes forever to find her headstone i always lose it you know
psn1F_sad_s251 so i was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and i thought that i would take the candy and put it on her headstone and
psn1F_sad_s253 yeah and she was like that's pathetic i hope you enjoy it
psn1F_sad_s254 and i you know i mean i said i was sorry and i brought it back to her kind of and i like put it on the ground and she was like no it's fine she was like i would rather have her back honestly
psn1F_sad_s255 i don't know it just like i felt so bad because i shouldn't have done it i don't know whatever
psn1F_sad_s256 i don't know
psn1F_sad_s257 at the cemetery
psn1F_sad_s258 couple hours
psn1F_sad_s262 it's weird whenever i go back to town i think of her i mean it's like i mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one and yeah she had cancer she had two brain tumors
psn1F_sad_s263 my best friend heather she's got a we have a we built this like little there's a park prospect park and there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her
psn1F_sad_s264 she used to have these poetry parties on memorial day
psn1F_sad_s265 umm yeah
psn1F_sad_s266 and the last time before she died i remember she couldn't really stand umm
psn1F_sad_s267 but i mean she could but it was so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized and i remember looking up she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head it was cool
psn1F_sad_s268 some i guess she memorized this one john dunn it's called death be not proud and
psn1F_sad_s270 i remember too when we were she died at u c l a she had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with but i gave blood for her surgery her mom and i before so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back and she in her wheelchair like can hardly do anything reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room all she needs is a god damn audience you know
psn1F_sad_s299 darling don't say that
psn1F_sad_s31 do you want to go somewhere let's go
psn1F_sad_s32 no no it's nothing like that
psn1F_sad_s322 and i remember thinking this is it finally finally i'm as happy as i'm supposed to be
psn1F_sad_s323 i'd rather not remember some things i'd rather not hope for some things
psn1F_sad_s324 no
psn1F_sad_s325 no
psn1F_sad_s329 this isn't anything like i thought anything would be
psn1F_sad_s33 i don't know it's it's complicated but it's going from me now
psn1F_sad_s330 this is just this i mean it includes a lot and everything but it's do you understand what i'm saying
psn1F_sad_s331 i know that augie i really do
psn1F_sad_s332 i just can't help wishing that i was somebody somewhere else
psn1F_sad_s333 i didn't say that
psn1F_sad_s334 you are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else someone who didn't take everything so seriously someone who would enjoy yourself
psn1F_sad_s337 augie i'm sorry
psn1F_sad_s34 i don't know
psn1F_sad_s35 it's kind of all mixed up with all these other things
psn1F_sad_s356 no no i'm just like you i thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and
psn1F_sad_s357 no you know what you get you know what you get you get this
psn1F_sad_s36 you know over seas i was in command of the company
psn1F_sad_s360 i know me neither
psn1F_sad_s361 i'm doing the best i can
psn1F_sad_s362 maybe if you were with somebody else too
psn1F_sad_s363 no i know but i know i don't make you happy
psn1F_sad_s364 yeah
psn1F_sad_s37 well i lost them
psn1F_sad_s38 pretty much all
psn1F_sad_s39 takes awhile to toss something like that off i mean they weren't just men you know
psn1F_sad_s40 for instance there was this one time when this kid it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks
psn1F_sad_s41 he just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys i had
psn1F_sad_s42 they didn't die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today
psn1F_sad_s43 and i had this idea as i was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed you know but i felt like this one new thing was being made you know it's kind of like this this monument
psn1F_sad_s44 you know that they were bringing something on to this earth a kind of sacrifice you know
psn1F_sad_s45 i thought i would change everything you know and i got back here and it was it was like nothing had changed at all
psn1F_sad_s455 i feel like i'm always just standing here waiting i feel like this night is going to be the night but it never is
psn1F_sad_s459 i'd rather not remember some things i'd rather not hope for some things
psn1F_sad_s46 you know i went to work with dad and i started that whole rat race again
psn1F_sad_s462 i know you are augie i know
psn1F_sad_s463 i know you meant this to be special i know that you wanted it to be right but i just can't help thinking that i can't help wishing that i was somewhere else
psn1F_sad_s464 i didn't say that
psn1F_sad_s465 you're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else somebody who doesn't take things so seriously who could enjoy herself
psn1F_sad_s47 and no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them
psn1F_sad_s471 augie i'm sorry
psn1F_sad_s48 driving my new car and i felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator
psn1F_sad_s486 maybe if you were with someone else too
psn1F_sad_s487 i just i know i don't make you happy
psn1F_sad_s49 'cause you can take those things out of a war but you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man
psn1F_sad_s499 i'm sorry to hear that
psn1F_sad_s50 and if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it
